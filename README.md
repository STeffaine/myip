# myip
a quick script that will tell you your WAN IP, should work for all debian based linux distro's.


you can download it and add to /usr/bin so you can call it anytime with "myip" with this command: 
>  `cd /usr/bin && sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STeffaine/myip/main/myip && sudo chmod +x myip && myip`

<br>

then run it with `myip`


<br>

or run it once with this:

> `bash -c "$(wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STeffaine/myip/main/myip)"`
