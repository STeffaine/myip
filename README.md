# myip
a quick script that will tell you your WAN IP, should work for all debian based linux distro's.


if you are feeling brave download and add to /usr/bin so you can call it anytime with "myip" with this command: 
>  `cd /usr/bin && sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STeffaine/myip/main/myip && sudo chmod +x myip && myip`
